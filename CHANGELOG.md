## 0.10.6 (April,8 2025)

### Notes

- Python Versions: **v3.8, v3.9, v3.10, v3.11**

### Bug Fix:

* ([#253](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-sdk-python/pull/253)) - Fixed `_create_conditions_v1` in ZPA `policies` package to ensure proper `conditions` block configuration

## 0.10.5 (March,13 2025)

### Notes

- Python Versions: **v3.8, v3.9, v3.10, v3.11**

### Bug Fix:

* ([#251](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-sdk-python/pull/251)) - Enhanced `pac_files` function resources.
  - `clone_pac_file` - The function pre-checks if total number of pac file versions within a specific pac file is == 10. If so, it triggers a error requiring the use of the parameter/attribute `delete_version`.
    **NOTE** A maximum of 10 pac file versions is supported. If the total limit is reached you must explicitly indicate via the `delete_version` parameter which version must be removed prior to invoking the `clone_pac_file` method again.

  - `update_pac_file` - The function now validates the current `pac_version_status` prior to attempting an update. The API endpoint behind the `update_pac_file` method requires the `pac_version_status` to have specific value in order to accept the call.

* ([#251](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-sdk-python/pull/251)) - Fixed `ZIAClientHelper` to prevent KeyError issues during time expiry check. [Issue 250](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-sdk-python/issues/250)
